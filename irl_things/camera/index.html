            <p>A while ago, I saw <a href="https://youtu.be/ewQQX3fxQKk" target="_blank">this youtube video</a>
                by AlphaPhoenix. In the video Brian made his own camera of sorts by using the cyanotype
                process. Inspired by this video, I had done exactly .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;nothing for 3 years.
            </p>
            <p>me when i sit on doing interesting stuff because i = lazy</p>
            <p>Later, my friend <a href="https://www.cocoamilka.art/gallery.html#:~:text=Polaroid Gallery" target="_blank">Cocoa</a>
                got herself a fancy Polaroid for taking <em>analog</em> photographs! This was super scary
                since she's all about computers and digital things. I had to one-up her, like wtf am I 
                supposed to do? Sit there and take it analog? So in retaliation, I had done 
                .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;nothing for half a year.
            </p>
            <p>remember? i = lazy</p>
            <p>Not too much later, <a href="https://youtu.be/BlWyKKJF0r4" target="_blank">this video</a> by 
                The Thought Emporium. Similarly, they tried to make a camera using the cyanotype process.
                The gimmick was that this was a literal potato camera.
            </p>
            <p>And, well, I finally was motivated enough to try out making a camera myself.</p>

            <h1 id="cyanotype_process">Cyanotype Process</h1>
            <p>The process is more simple than one would think:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Take the two chemicals, Potassium Ferricyanide and Ferric Ammonium Citrate and mix
                    them together. 
                    <ul><li>Dissolve this micture in water.</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>Coat a sheet of paper or whatever with the mixture.</li>
                <li>Suddenly, you now have a photosensitive "film"!</li>
                <li>A typical cyanotype user will then place an semi or completely opaque object over
                     the film and leave it out in sunlight or UV light (such as a blacklight).
                </li>
                <li>The mixture, when exposed to UV light, reacts and forms a deep blue color
                    <ul><li>The shaded spots from the object does not react!</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li>Finally, bring the film back without any sun or UV light.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Just as the mixture was dissolved in water before reacting, the unreacted
                             spots can be dissolved back into the water.
                        </li>
                        <li>The reacted spots, on the other hand, cannot be dissovled into water.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Simply wash the film in water until you are left with a pretty blue sheet!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Now, here comes the more interesting part: the film doesn't <em>need</em> to be in direct
                sunlight or UV light; the UV light can pass through a lens! Using focused light through 
                a lens will have the same result! The brighter spots will cause the film to turn the deep
                blue color and the darker spots will remain unreacted! Thus, a camera is born.
            </p>
            <p>In order for the film not to react to outside light not from the lens, it should be inside
                a box or something to keep only the focused light hitting the film. This can be accomplished
                with a box of plywood or even a potato, but I decided to use a shoebox because idk i just
                had spare one. i didn't want to be fancy; i = lazy
            </p>
