    <p>Welcome to <strike>Windows XP</strike> Rainbows X3</p>
    <p>This is still a demonstration of what I wanna do with this site! This may become a page for links to friends/interesting sites.</p>
    <p>This functions as one would expect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Drag the title bar to move windows</li>
        <li>Minimize to keep the window here but make it invisible</li>
        <li>*Maximize to open in a new tab*</li>
        <li>Close to remove the window entirely</li>
        <li>Click a title on the taskbar to minimize/restore a window</li>
        <li>Click the mute button (bottom right) to mute the startup/shutdown sounds</li>
        <li>Click the start button to open up new windows</li>
        <li>Turn off the computer to go back home</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The way this functions is using the magic of the iframe html element to embed any website into this one! I did a lot of styles to make things look good enough. Everything opened in a window on this site was
        <strong>not</strong> made by me. I do not claim responsibility for any fun experiences you may have on other sites seen here :'3
    </p>
    <p>p.s. sorry about the ad on minesweeper, it was the only real good one that embedded well. Please install an adblock; it really improves the web experience on every site!</p>
